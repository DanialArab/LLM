## Introduction 

+ The real power of LLMs is to use them as a developer tool like making API calls to LLMs to quickly build software applications.

+ So the way that instruction-tuned LLMs are typically trained is you start off with a base LLM that's been trained on a huge amount of text data and further train it, further fine-tune it with inputs and outputs that are instructions and good attempts to follow those instructions, and then often further refine using a technique called RLHF, reinforcement learning from human feedback, to make the system better able to be helpful and follow instructions.
+ This course will focus on best practices for **instruction-tuned LLMs**, which is what we recommend you use for most of your applications.
